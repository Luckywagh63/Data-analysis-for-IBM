## Installation

To get started with this project, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the required libraries using the following commands:

```
pip install pandas matplotlib scipy numpy seaborn
```



### Analysis  
The analysis is carried out using the following Python libraries:  
-Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.  
-Matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.  
-Scipy: For scientific and technical computing.  
-Numpy: For numerical operations.  
-Seaborn: For statistical data visualization.  


### Steps:  
-Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data entries.  
-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the data distribution and relationships between variables.  
-Data Visualization: Creating graphs and plots to visualize the data.  
-Statistical Analysis: Applying statistical methods to analyze the data and derive insights.
